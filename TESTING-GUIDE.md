## Test Scenarios

### üõí Test 1: Add Sale (Basic)

**Steps:**
1. Go to Sales tab

- ‚úÖ Customer balance increases by 5,000
- ‚úÖ Customer transactions show new sale
- ‚úÖ Stock quantity decreases by 10 (if location is not Direct)
- ‚úÖ No errors in console

SELECT * FROM stocks WHERE location = 'Shop A';
```

### üéØ Test 2: Direct Sale with Product (Purchase Card Creation)

**Steps:**
1. Go to Sales tab
2. Click "Add Sale"
3. Fill in:

**Database Verification:**
```sql
-- Check sale
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE location IN ('Direct', 'Company Goddam', 'none') 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check auto-generated purchase card
SELECT * FROM purchases WHERE is_from_sale = true 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**This tests the critical `after_sale_insert` trigger!**

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Customer not found"
**Cause:** Customer name doesn't match database
**Solution:** Ensure customer exists in database first, or check for typos

### Issue 2: "Stock location not found"
**Cause:** Stock location doesn't exist or name mismatch
**Solution:** Create stock location first in Stock Management

### Issue 3: "Supplier not found"
**Cause:** Product/brand doesn't exist in products table
**Solution:** Add the product/brand first

### Issue 4: Purchase card not created after Direct sale
**Cause:** Either location is not 'Direct/Company Goddam/none' OR product not selected
**Solution:** Ensure BOTH conditions are met:
- Location = Direct/Company Goddam/none
- Product/Brand is selected (not "none")

### Issue 5: Stock quantity not updating
**Cause:** Possible trigger error or location mismatch
**Solution:** Check console for errors, verify location name matches exactly

## üîç Database Debugging

### Check Trigger Status
```sql
-- View all triggers
SELECT trigger_name, event_object_table, action_statement 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public';

-- Check if triggers are enabled
SELECT tgname, tgenabled FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname LIKE '%sale%' OR tgname LIKE '%dump%';
```

### View Recent Activity
```sql
-- Recent sales
SELECT s.*, c.name as customer_name, st.location 
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN stocks st ON s.stock_id = st.id
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Recent customer transactions
SELECT ct.*, c.name as customer_name 
FROM customer_transactions ct
JOIN customers c ON ct.customer_id = c.id
ORDER BY ct.created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Recent purchases (including auto-generated)
SELECT p.*, pr.name as product_name, s.name as supplier_name
FROM purchases p
LEFT JOIN products pr ON p.product_id = pr.id
LEFT JOIN products s ON p.supplier_id = s.id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Data Integrity
```sql
-- Verify customer balances match transactions
SELECT 
  c.name,
  c.balance as stored_balance,
  COALESCE(SUM(ct.amount), 0) as calculated_balance
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN customer_transactions ct ON c.id = ct.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.balance
HAVING c.balance != COALESCE(SUM(ct.amount), 0);
-- Should return 0 rows if everything is correct
```

## üéâ When Everything Works

You should see:
1. **Zero console errors** during all operations
2. **Instant UI updates** after each operation
3. **Database triggers executing automatically** (check with SQL queries)
4. **Consistent data** across all views and tables
5. **Proper error messages** if something fails

---

## üÜò If Tests Fail

1. **Check Console:** Look for error messages
2. **Check Network Tab:** Look for failed API calls to Supabase
3. **Check Database:** Run SQL queries to see if data was actually inserted
4. **Check Triggers:** Verify triggers are enabled and executing
5. **Check Schema:** Ensure all tables and columns exist as expected

---

## üìû Support

If issues persist:
1. Check `PHASE4-CRUD-MIGRATIONS-COMPLETE.md` for implementation details
2. Review `supabase-schema.sql` for trigger definitions
3. Check Supabase logs in dashboard for backend errors
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly (`.env.local`)

**Happy Testing! üöÄ**
