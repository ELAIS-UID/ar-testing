# 🔧 Purchase Module - Delete & Edit Button Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Delete Button Not Working
**Problem:** Clicking delete button had no effect
**Root Cause:** Using local state `setPurchaseData()` instead of calling Supabase `deletePurchase()` function
**Fix:** Now properly calls `deletePurchase()` and `refreshPurchases()`

### ✅ Issue 2: Dump Transactions Showing Edit Button
**Problem:** Clicking edit on a dump opened "Add New Purchase" dialog
**Root Cause:** No check for `is_dump` field - all transactions showed edit button
**Fix:** Edit button now hidden for dump transactions using `{!(purchase as any).is_dump && ...}`

### ✅ Issue 3: Editing Creates Duplicates
**Problem:** Editing a purchase created a new entry instead of updating
**Root Cause:** When delete worked via local state only, edit would create duplicates
**Fix:** Delete now properly removes from database, preventing orphaned records

### ✅ Issue 4: Edited Dump Loses DUMP Badge
**Problem:** After editing a dump (which shouldn't happen), it loses the DUMP badge
**Root Cause:** Edit form doesn't preserve `is_dump` field
**Fix:** Dumps can no longer be edited (edit button hidden)

## What Changed

### Before (Broken):
```tsx
// Delete button - WRONG (only removed from local state)
onClick={() => {
  if (window.confirm(...)) {
    setPurchaseData(prev => prev.filter(...))  // ❌ Only local
  }
}}

// Edit button - WRONG (shown for all transactions)
<Button onClick={() => {
  setEditingPurchaseId(purchase.id)
  setShowAddPurchase(true)  // ❌ Opens purchase form for dumps
}}>
  Edit
</Button>
```

### After (Fixed):
```tsx
// Delete button - CORRECT (deletes from database)
onClick={async () => {
  const itemType = (purchase as any).is_dump ? 'dump' : 'purchase'
  if (window.confirm(`Delete this ${itemType}?`)) {
    await deletePurchase(purchase.id)  // ✅ Deletes from Supabase
    await refreshPurchases()  // ✅ Refreshes UI
  }
}}

// Edit button - CORRECT (hidden for dumps)
{!(purchase as any).is_dump && (  // ✅ Only show for regular purchases
  <Button onClick={() => {
    setEditingPurchaseId(purchase.id)
    setShowAddPurchase(true)
  }}>
    Edit
  </Button>
)}
```

## Why Dumps Shouldn't Be Editable

Dumps are created automatically by stock movements and have special properties:
- `price_per_unit = 0` (no cost)
- `is_dump = TRUE` (marked as dump)
- `category` from stock sub-category
- Linked to `stock_events` table

Editing them through the purchase form would:
- ❌ Break the link to stock_events
- ❌ Allow setting non-zero prices
- ❌ Potentially lose the `is_dump` flag
- ❌ Create inconsistency between stock and purchases

**Dumps should only be deleted, not edited.**

## Transaction Card Buttons Now

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [JSW G.V]              [✏️] [🗑️] │  ← Both edit and delete
│ 300 bags × ₹500 = ₹150,000     │
│ 2025-10-07                      │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Dump Transaction Card:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [JSW G.V] [DUMP]           [🗑️] │  ← Only delete (no edit)
│ 30 bags × ₹0 = ₹0              │
│ 2025-10-06                      │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```
